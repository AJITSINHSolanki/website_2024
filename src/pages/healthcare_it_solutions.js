                NLP has revolutionized the way we interact with databases and
                analyze text data. Incorporating NLP techniques into relational,
                NoSQL, and graph databases unlocks the potential of unstructured
                text data. Enables efficient querying, analysis, and extraction
                of insights. Integration of NLP in database querying and text
