                    <b>"This Agreement":</b>This refers to the document or
                    contract in which these terms and conditions are stated.
                    It's the agreement between two parties, typically a company
                    or service provider and a user or customer.

                    <b>"General Terms":</b> These are the overarching terms and
                    conditions that apply to the entire agreement. They
                    typically cover general rules, rights, and obligations that
                    both parties must adhere to.

                    and conditions that are specific to particular services or
                    products offered within the agreement. They provide more
                    detailed information about how certain services are to be
                    used or what specific rules apply to them.

                    inconsistencies between the General Terms and the Service
                    Specific Terms.

                    <b>"The Service Specific Terms shall prevail": </b>This
                    means that if there is a conflict between the General Terms
                    and the Service Specific Terms, the Service Specific Terms
                    will take precedence. In other words, the rules and
                    conditions specific to a particular service or product will
                    be followed over the more general terms.

              <p>
                Overall, this clause is designed to ensure that users understand
                that the agreement consists of both general terms applicable to
                the entire agreement and specific terms that apply to individual
                services or products. It also clarifies which set of terms
                should be followed in case of any conflicts between them.
